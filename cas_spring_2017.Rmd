# Why Should I Use <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>
> "These technological changes are quite fundamental and will materially alter the way that actuaries do their work and what work actuaries do. As the technology advances, the complexity of the work will increase, making the approaches I used in the middle of my career seem simplistic by comparison. For example, aggregating data into loss development triangles may be completely supplanted by analysis at the claim level, looking at the attributes of claims that are predictive of their future development."

# Why Should I Use <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>

> "There are definitely some academic statisticians who just don't understand why what I do is statistics, but basically I think they are all wrong . What I do is fundamentally statistics. The fact that ~~data science exists as a field~~ **insurers feel the need to hire  data scientists** is a colossal failure of ~~statistics~~ **the acturial profession**. To me, that is what statistics is all about. It is gaining insight from data using modelling and visualization. Data munging and manipulation is hard and statistics has just said that's not our domain."

# What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>

> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> has had a revolutionary effect on the way statistics are communicated.  
> --- John Chambers

<ol>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. </li>
  <li> One of <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>'s strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control.</li>
  <li> <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License in source code form.</li>
</ol>

# What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>?
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for **data manipulation, calculation and graphical display.** It includes an effective **data handling** and storage facility, a suite of operators for **calculations on arrays, in particular matrices**, a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for **data analysis, graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and a well-developed, simple and effective programming language** which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.

# What is <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>?
<code class="remark-inline-code">R</code>, like <code class="remark-inline-code">S</code>, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. 

Many users think of <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the <code class="remark-inline-code">R</code> distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.
